## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. **Web App Parity**

The mobile app now has the same feature set as the web app:

- ✅ Full financial details display
- ✅ Additional services/expenses tracking
- ✅ Payments & Income table
- ✅ Tab-based navigation
- ✅ Currency selection
- ✅ Balance calculations
- ✅ Payment method and type categorization

### 2. **Mobile-First UI Adaptations**

- Replaced table layouts with card-based designs
- Used Ionicons instead of Lucide icons
- Implemented pull-to-refresh patterns
- Optimized for touch interactions
- Better spacing for mobile screens

### 3. **Data Flow Architecture**

```
useReservationsData → ReservationsList → ReservationExpensesDisplay
                                       ↓
                                  useIncomeData

usePaymentsData → PaymentsTable
```

### 4. **Component Hierarchy**

```
ReservationsScreen
├── ReservationsHeader (tab switcher)
├── ReservationsFilters
├── [Conditional Rendering]
│   ├── ReservationsList (if activeTab === "reservations")
│   │   └── ReservationExpensesDisplay (per reservation)
│   └── PaymentsTable (if activeTab === "payments")
└── [Dialogs]
    ├── ViewReservationDialog
    ├── EditReservationDialog
    ├── PaymentDialog
    ├── CompactReservationDialog
    └── NewReservationDialog
```

## Database Integration

### Tables Used:

1. **reservations** - Main reservation data with financials
2. **income** - Payment and service records
3. **accounts** - Account information for payments
4. **rooms** - Room details (number, type, amenities)
5. **locations** - Location information

### Key Queries:

- Reservations with room and location details (left joins)
- Income records filtered by booking_id
- Payments with nested reservation and account data

## Icon Migration

### Before (Web App):

```tsx
import { Calendar, DollarSign, MapPin, Eye } from "lucide-react-native";
```

### After (Mobile App):

```tsx
import { Ionicons } from "@expo/vector-icons";
// Usage: <Ionicons name="calendar-outline" size={14} color="#6B7280" />
```

### Icon Mapping:

- `Calendar` → `calendar-outline`
- `DollarSign` → `cash-outline`
- `MapPin` → `location-outline`
- `Eye` → `eye-outline`
- `CreditCard` → `card-outline`
- `Building2` → `business-outline`
